<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Laravel is free, open-source software, meaning anyone can contribute to its development and progress. Laravel source code is currently hosted on <a href="https://github.com/laravel">Github</a>, which provides an easy method for forking the project and merging your contributions.</p>

<p>&lt;a name=&quot;pull-requests&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<h2>Pull Requests</h2>

<p>The pull request process differs for new features and bugs. Before sending a pull request for a new feature, you should first create an issue with <code>[Proposal]</code> in the title. The proposal should describe the new feature, as well as implementation ideas. The proposal will then be reviewed and either approved or denied. Once a proposal is approved, a pull request may be created implementing the new feature. Pull requests which do not follow this guideline will be closed immediately.</p>

<p>Pull requests for bugs may be sent without creating any proposal issue. If you believe that you know of a solution for a bug that has been filed on Github, please leave a comment detailing your proposed fix.</p>

<p>Additions and corrections to the documentation may also be contributed via the <a href="https://github.com/laravel/docs">documentation repository</a> on Github.</p>

<h3>Feature Requests</h3>

<p>If you have an idea for a new feature you would like to see added to Laravel, you may create an issue on Github with <code>[Request]</code> in the title. The feature request will then be reviewed by a core contributor.</p>
