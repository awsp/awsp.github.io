<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Laravel is an open-source project and anyone may contribute to Laravel for its improvement. We welcome contributors, regardless of skill level, gender, race, religion, or nationality. Having a diverse, vibrant community is one of the core values of the framework!</p>

<p>To encourage active collaboration, Laravel currently only accepts pull requests, not bug reports. &quot;Bug reports&quot; may be sent in the form of a pull request containing a failing unit test. Alternatively, a demonstration of the bug within a sandbox Laravel application may be sent as a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/laravel/laravel">main Laravel repository</a>. A failing unit test or sandbox application provides the development team &quot;proof&quot; that the bug exists, and, after the development team addresses the bug, serves as a reliable indicator that the bug remains fixed.</p>

<p>The Laravel source code is managed on Github, and there are repositories for each of the Laravel projects:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/laravel/framework">Laravel Framework</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/laravel/laravel">Laravel Application</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/laravel/docs">Laravel Documentation</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/laravel/cashier">Laravel Cashier</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/laravel/envoy">Laravel Envoy</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/laravel/homestead">Laravel Homestead</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/laravel/settler">Laravel Homestead Build Scripts</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/laravel/laravel.com">Laravel Website</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/laravel/art">Laravel Art</a></li></ul>

<p>&lt;a name=&quot;core-development-discussion&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<h2>Core Development Discussion</h2>

<p>Discussion regarding bugs, new features, and implementation of existing features takes place in the <code>#laravel-dev</code> IRC channel (Freenode). Taylor Otwell, the maintainer of Laravel, is typically present in the channel on weekdays from 8am-5pm (UTC-06:00 or America/Chicago), and sporadically present in the channel at other times.</p>

<p>The <code>#laravel-dev</code> IRC channel is open to all. All are welcome to join the channel either to participate or simply observe the discussions!</p>

<p>&lt;a name=&quot;new-features&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<p>Before sending pull requests for new features, please contact Taylor Otwell via the <code>#laravel-dev</code> IRC channel (Freenode). If the feature is found to be a good fit for the framework, you are free to make a pull request. If the feature is rejected, don&#39;t give up! You are still free to turn your feature into a package which can be released to the world via <a href="https://packagist.org/">Packagist</a>.</p>

<p>When adding new features, don&#39;t forget to add unit tests! Unit tests help ensure the stability and reliability of the framework as new features are added.</p>

<p>&lt;a name=&quot;bugs&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<h2>Bugs</h2>

<h3>Via Unit Test</h3>

<p>Pull requests for bugs may be sent without prior discussion with the Laravel development team. When submitting a bug fix, try to include a unit test that ensures the bug never appears again!</p>

<p>If you believe you have found a bug in the framework, but are unsure how to fix it, please send a pull request containing a failing unit test. A failing unit test provides the development team &quot;proof&quot; that the bug exists, and, after the development team addresses the bug, serves as a reliable indicator that the bug remains fixed.</p>

<p>If are unsure how to write a failing unit test for a bug, review the other unit tests included with the framework. If you&#39;re still lost, you may ask for help in the <code>#laravel</code> IRC channel (Freenode).</p>

<p>&lt;a name=&quot;which-branch&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<h2>Which Branch?</h2>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> This section primarly applies to those sending pull requests to the <a href="https://github.com/laravel/framework">laravel/framework</a> repository, not Liferaft applications.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>All</strong> bug fixes should be sent to the latest stable branch. Bug fixes should <strong>never</strong> be sent to the <code>master</code> branch unless they fix features that exist only in the upcoming release.</p>

<p><strong>Minor</strong> features that are <strong>fully backwards compatible</strong> with the current Laravel release may be sent to the latest stable branch.</p>

<p><strong>Major</strong> new features should always be sent to the <code>master</code> branch, which contains the upcoming Laravel release.</p>

<p>If you are unsure if your feature qualifies as a major or minor, please ask Taylor Otwell in the <code>#laravel-dev</code> IRC channel (Freenode).</p>

<p>&lt;a name=&quot;security-vulnerabilities&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<h2>Security Vulnerabilities</h2>

<p>If you discover a security vulnerability within Laravel, please send an e-mail to Taylor Otwell at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:taylorotwell@gmail.com&quot;&gt;taylorotwell@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.</p>

<p>&lt;a name=&quot;coding-style&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<h2>Coding Style</h2>

<p>Laravel follows the <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md">PSR-0</a> and <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md">PSR-1</a> coding standards. In addition to these standards, the following coding standards should be followed:</p>

<ul><li>The class namespace declaration must be on the same line as <code>&lt;?php</code>.</li><li>A class&#39; opening <code>{</code> must be on the same line as the class name.</li><li>Functions and control structures must use Allman style braces.</li><li>Indent with tabs, align with spaces.</li></ul>
